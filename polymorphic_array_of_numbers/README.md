Create a base class `Number` 
* Class `Number`has a pure virtual member function `double get_square()`. This function calculates the square of the number**.
* Create two derivied classes `Complex` and `Real`, which have appropriate constructors for representing the numbers.
* Make a polymorphic array of numbers - real and complex. 
* For each element of the array print the type of the number and the square of the number.

** if the number is complex, the function returns `a^2 + b^2`, where `a + ib` is a complex number
