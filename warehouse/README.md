Write a program that accepts commands until the end of the standard input (CTRL+D) for warehouse management. Each command consists of two parts: a word (string) and a product identifier (integer). The program should support the following commands:
* ```add 12``` - adds 1 unit to product with id 12. If such product does not exists, the program should add 1 element at the end of two parallel  vectors. One vector will be used to store the ids and the other - to store the quantities, e.g. 12 will be added to the first vector and 1 to the end of the second one. If the product exists, the program should find the corresponding element and increase the quantity with 1.
* ```get 8``` - takes 1 unit of product with id 8. If the product exists, find and decrease its quantity by 1. If the quantity becomes 0, remove the corresponding elements from the two vectors. If the product does not exist, output error ```NOT FOUND```.
* ```show 1024``` - outputs the quantity of product with id 1024. If the product does not exist, output 0.
